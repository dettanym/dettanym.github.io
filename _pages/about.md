Hi there! This is Miti Mazmudar's personal homepage. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I research privacy-enhancing technologies. My supervisor is [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). I work at the [CrySP (Cryptography, Security and Privacy) lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca)! 

My [Masters thesis research](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/14765) was focused on ensuring compliance of privacy policies with source code using trusted hardware platforms. Lately, I have been working on inferencers for differential privacy as well as censorship-resistant publishing systems. In general, I am interested in designing and implementing tools that help people protect their privacy!
