Hi there! This is Miti Mazmudar's personal homepage. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I research privacy-enhancing technologies. [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/) is my supervisor. I work at the [CrySP (Cryptography, Security and Privacy) lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca)!
