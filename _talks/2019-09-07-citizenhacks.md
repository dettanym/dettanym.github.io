Conventional software engineering paradigms do not require developers to engage in determining the privacy-relevant aspects of their design and thus often result in privacy horror shows. The Privacy by Design (PbD) paradigm addresses this shortcoming, but in order to implement the principles of PbD, developers need to know relevant tools. This workshop introduces privacy enhancing technologies (PETS) to address various aspects of a privacy-by-design approach, through online walkthroughs of deployed technologies or through examples of prototypes.
