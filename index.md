Miti Mazmudar is an [Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/miti-mazmudar) at the University of Calgary. Her research is at the intersection of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and software engineering, with an emphasis on human-centered approaches. She designs efficient privacy-enhancing technologies, for the benefit of their target users, and integrates them into modern distributed architectures and software engineering lifecycles. In general, she is interested in designing and implementing tools that help people protect their privacy!

Prior to joining University of Calgary, Miti received her PhD in Computer Science and her Masters of Mathematics, both from the University of Waterloo. She was part of the  [CrySP (Cryptography, Security and Privacy) lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca) and was supervised by [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/). 

**Openings.**
I am looking to fill two fully-funded positions: **one MSc** and **one PhD** position, both beginning from Fall (September) 2026. If you're interested in my research, you should apply for these positions! You should go through the [application process](https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/graduate/admissions/how-apply), [graduate programs in CS](https://science.ucalgary.ca/computer-science/future-students/graduate/thesis-programs) and [degree requirements for graduate programs in CS](https://science.ucalgary.ca/computer-science/future-students/graduate/degree-requirements).  

It is common in Canada to do a thesis-based Masters before a PhD; this gives you an opportunity to “taste” what doing research involves, before committing to a PhD. If you have already done a coursework based Masters and want to do a PhD, you should go through the degree requirements of a PhD at UCalgary.

You should submit your application through the usual process and email me as well. You may find my email address from one of my papers. Please email me with your CV (including GitHub and Google Scholar, if applicable), transcripts, and research statement (no more than 2 pages). Ensure that the subject line starts with "UofC Application". 

Undergrad Research Projects (CPSC 502/503): If you wish me to supervise you through your independent study courses, please email me well in advance of the start of the term.
