How to make an app that is not a privacy horror show	Talk  talk-1	Citizen Hacks 2019-09-07	Toronto, Canada Conventional software engineering paradigms do not require developers to engage in determining the privacy-relevant aspects of their design and thus often result in privacy horror shows. The Privacy by Design (PbD) paradigm addresses this shortcoming, but in order to implement the principles of PbD, developers need to know relevant tools. This workshop focuses on the problem of authenticating individuals without collecting sensitive data, gently motivates a solution through zero-knowledge attribute-based credentials scheme and walks through a deployed example: namely, the IRMA (I-Revoke-My-Credentials) scheme.
