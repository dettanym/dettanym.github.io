How to make an app that is not a privacy horror show  Talk  talk-1  Citizen Hacks 2019-09-07  Toronto, Canada Conventional software engineering paradigms do not require developers to engage in determining the privacy-relevant aspects of their design and thus often result in privacy horror shows.

This workshop focuses on the problem of authenticating individuals without collecting sensitive data, gently motivates a solution through zero-knowledge attribute-based credentials scheme and walks through a deployed example: namely, the IRMA (I-Revoke-My-Credentials) scheme.
